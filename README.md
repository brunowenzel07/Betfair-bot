# Betfair-bot

The repo provides the core makings of a Betfair bot. A front end is required, but the documents provide the ability to connect 
to any of the thousands of Betfair markets, from which you can monitor traded volumes on selections. Data is parsed in JSON and can be 
used to identify market patterns to form one of many profitable betting strategies. 

Account settings can be linked to provide automated functionality (not included).
